Algorithm Explanation : <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array>

> In computer science, a suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a string. It is a data structure used in, among others, full text indices, data compression algorithms, and the field of bibliometrics.

```
vector<int> pn(n), cn(n);
    for (int h = 0; (1 << h) < n; ++h) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            pn[i] = p[i] - (1 << h);
            if (pn[i] < 0)
                pn[i] += n;
        }
        fill(cnt.begin(), cnt.begin() + classes, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            cnt[c[pn[i]]]++;
        for (int i = 1; i < classes; i++)
            cnt[i] += cnt[i-1];
        for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--)
            p[--cnt[c[pn[i]]]] = pn[i];
        cn[p[0]] = 0;
        classes = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            pair<int, int> cur = {c[p[i]], c[(p[i] + (1 << h)) % n]};
            pair<int, int> prev = {c[p[i-1]], c[(p[i-1] + (1 << h)) % n]};
            if (cur != prev)
